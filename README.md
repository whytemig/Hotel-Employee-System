## Why?

As someone who absolutely loves the idea of being punctual and organized, my curiosity got the best of me when it came to exploring the design, functionality, and the use of intricate custom components in creating such a large-scale project. I was particularly fascinated by the aspect of establishing charts â€“ I must say, the functionality behind it truly intrigued me!

Alot of custom components was used in this project, and of coarse i recieved alot of errors and alot googling, chatgtp-ing was used on correcting them. I learned an advanced react reusable components that i was introduced to from an online coarse i took. I believe implementing those components was too advance for me at my level. And, I require alot more practice in order to master that particular skill.
